## üîß Usage Examples

### 1. Complete Payment Flow (Manual)

```javascript
// 1. Create payment
const payment = await fetch('/api/v1/payments/create-mine', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    amount: 100000,
    creditsAmount: 100,
    paymentMethod: 'Bank Transfer'
  })
});

// 2. User makes payment manually (outside system)
// 3. Admin confirms payment
const confirmation = await fetch(`/api/v1/payments/${paymentId}/mark-paid`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    paymentMethod: 'Bank Transfer - BCA',
    adminNotes: 'Payment verified via bank statement'
  })
});

// Automatically:
// - Credits added to user
// - Confirmation email sent
// - Receipt PDF generated and emailed
```

### 2. Admin Payment Management

```javascript
// Get pending payments
const pending = await fetch('/api/v1/payments/pending', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN' }
});

// Update multiple payments
for (const payment of pendingPayments) {
  await fetch(`/api/v1/payments/${payment.id}/mark-paid`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer ADMIN_TOKEN',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      paymentMethod: 'Bank Transfer',
      adminNotes: 'Bulk confirmation'
    })
  });
}
```

### 3. User Payment History

```javascript
// Get my payment history
const myPayments = await fetch('/api/v1/payments/my-payments?page=1&limit=10', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer USER_TOKEN' }
});

// Filter by status
const paidOnly = await fetch('/api/v1/payments/my-payments?status=PAID', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer USER_TOKEN' }
});
```

## üöÄ Testing

### Test Email Configuration
```javascript
const emailService = new EmailService();
const isConfigValid = await emailService.testEmailConfiguration();
console.log('Email config valid:', isConfigValid);
```

### Generate Test Receipt
```javascript
const receiptService = new ReceiptService();
const receiptPath = await receiptService.generateReceipt(paymentData);
console.log('Receipt generated:', receiptPath);
```

## üìã Status Codes

- `PENDING` - Payment created, waiting for confirmation
- `PAID` - Payment confirmed, credits added
- `FAILED` - Payment failed or rejected
- `CANCELLED` - Payment cancelled by admin or user

---

## üîí Security Features

1. **Authentication Required** - All endpoints require valid JWT
2. **Role-based Access** - Admin endpoints restricted to admin users
3. **Owner Validation** - Users can only access their own payments
4. **Input Validation** - Zod schema validation on all inputs
5. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling and logging

---

## üìù Next Steps

The payment system is now ready for use. To complete the implementation:

1. **Run Database Migration** (when services are stopped)
2. **Configure Email Settings** in environment variables
3. **Test Payment Flow** with sample data
4. **Build Admin Dashboard** for payment management
5. **Create Frontend Interface** for user payment history

---

## üìû Support

For issues with the payment system:
- Check logs in `logs/` directory
- Verify email configuration with test endpoint
- Ensure database migration has been run
